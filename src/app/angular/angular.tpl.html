                Articulate Angular is loosely based on ng-boilerplate, angular-seed and some other angular projects from github. The boilerplate should not serve
                only as a structure, a layout for your Angular project, but more like a example of good practices for the structure and code of a project.
                I chose to make it more complex so that the users see how different Angular components interact with themselves and outside libraries, and to
                grasp the dependency and the way the logic is built in a friendly modular manner for a fully blown complex application.

                Fret not, I intend to have EVERY bit of code commented for full transparency, so that everyone new who comes to Angular will have an easy ( you still need to know JavaScript though ) time with it.

                If you have used ng-boilerplate in the past, you'll feel right at home, I made a ton of improvements on the grunt build side, mixed in the way the
                Angular seed project bootstraps asynchronously the files so the page is free to load, with an added bonus of tweaking the $script.js dependency injection.
