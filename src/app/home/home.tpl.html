    Articulate Angular seed is a more complex boilerplate for a Angular SPA application.

    This is a work in progress and should be treated accordingly, I estimate about two months of part time work on this from my side to get the app in a state that I can say it's usable, with a lot of improvements down the road.
    Feel free to post issues on the github page, this won't be perfect and there will be problems here and here, but with creative and constructive input from the community this can be a good project for anyone
    who wants to dig into a fully fledged open source AngularJS project built with some great tools.


    It is loosely based on ng-boilerplate, angular-seed and some other angular projects from github. The boilerplate should not serve
    only as a structure, a layout for your Angular project, but more like a example of good practices for the structure and code of a project.
    I chose to make it more complex so that the users see how different Angular components interact with themselves and outside libraries, and to
    grasp the dependency and the way the logic is built in a friendly modular manner.

    Fret not, I intend to have EVERY bit of code commented for full transparency, so that everyone new who comes to Angular will have an easy ( you still need to know JavaScript though ) time with it.

    If you have used ng-boilerplate in the past, you'll feel right at home, I made a ton of improvements on the grunt build side, mixed in the way the
    Angular seed project bootstraps asynchronously the files so the page is free to load, with an added bonus of tweaking the $script.js dependency injection.
